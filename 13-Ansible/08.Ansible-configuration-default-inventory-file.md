# Default inventory file for Ansible
This is used when we don't specify any inventory file while running the playbook.


* to Configure that we need to change some configuration in the `ansible.cfg` file.


```yaml
[defaults]
host_key_checking = False
inventory = /etc/ansible/hosts # location of host file
```

* Now we can run the playbook without specifying the inventory file.

* The above will configure the default inventory file for ansible if we don't specify any inventory file while running the playbook.
