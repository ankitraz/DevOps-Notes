# Playbooks

Ansible playbooks are written in YAML format. They are used to automate the configuration of the servers. Playbooks are stored in a file with `.yml` extension.

* Playbooks conatains the list of tasks that are to be executed on the servers encapsulated in a play.

* Creating a playbook
    ```yaml
    ---
    - name: CONFIGURE NGINX WEB SERVER       # this is a play
      hosts: <nameofhost>             # this is a group of hosts
      become: yes           # this is a privilege escalation
      tasks:            # this is a list of tasks
        - name: INSTALL NGINX
          yum:
            name: nginx
            state: started
    ```

* When we run this playbook, ansible will connect to the host and install nginx on it.

* command to run this playbook - `ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook.yml`

* Gather facts is a module that is used to gather the facts about the host. Facts are the information about the host. For example, the operating system of the host, the IP address of the host, the hostname of the host, etc.

* Ansible is idempotent. It means that if we run the same playbook multiple times, it will not change the state of the host. It will only change the state of the host if the state of the host is different from the state that we want to configure.

* Ansible is declarative. It means that we need to tell ansible what we want to configure on the host. We don't need to tell ansible how to configure the host.
