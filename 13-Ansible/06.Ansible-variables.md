# Ansible Variables

## What are variables?

Variables are used to store the data. We can use variables to store the data that we want to use in our playbooks. We can also use variables to store the data that we want to use in our templates.


* We have already used variables in our playbooks.
* We used `Register` to store the output of a command in a variable.
* Variables make our playbook more dynamic and reusable. We can use the same playbook for different environments by changing the variables.

## Referencing variables

* We can reference the variables in our playbooks using double curly braces `{{}}`.

```yaml
---
- name: CONFIGURE NGINX WEB SERVER
  hosts: <nameofhost>
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: INSTALL NGINX
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: "{{nginx_state}}"
```

Note: It is important to quote the whole expression to create a valid YAML file.

* but if you want to interpolate a variable in a string, you dont need quotation marks then.

```yaml
---
- name: Deploy nodejs app
  hosts: <nameofhost>
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: unpack the nodejs file
      unarchive:
        src: /home/ankit/my_workspace/Ansible/project-1/nodejs-app-{{version-number}}.tgz
        dest: /home/ankit/
        remote_src: yes
```


## Setting Variables in playbook

### First way is using `vars` keyword

```yaml
---
- name: Deploy nodejs app
  hosts: <nameofhost>
  become: true
  vars:
    version-number: 1.0.0 # this is a variable value. you can also set multiple variables in this way.
  tasks:
    - name: unpack the nodejs file
      unarchive:
        src: /home/ankit/my_workspace/Ansible/project-1/nodejs-app-{{version-number}}.tgz
        dest: /home/ankit/
        remote_src: yes
```

### Second Way is passing Variable on the Command Line
```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts deploy-nodejs-app.yml -e "version-number=1.0.0"
```

* `-e` or `--extra-vars` is used to pass variables on the command line.

* We can also pass the list of variables on the command line.

```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts deploy-nodejs-app.yml -e "version-number=1.0.0 app_name=app1"
```

### Third ways is using a file to store variables
```bash
touch project-vars # create a file
```
* Add the variables in the file
```yaml
version-number: 1.0.0
key: value # this is the format of setting variables in a file

```

* Now we can reference the variables in our playbook using `vars_files` keyword.

```yaml
---
- name: Deploy nodejs app
  hosts: <nameofhost>
  become: true
  vars_files:
    - project-vars # this is the file name of our variables file
  tasks:
    - name: unpack the nodejs file
      unarchive:
        src: /home/ankit/my_workspace/Ansible/project-1/nodejs-app-{{version-number}}.tgz
        dest: /home/ankit/
        remote_src: yes
