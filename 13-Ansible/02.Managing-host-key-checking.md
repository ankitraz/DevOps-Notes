# Host Key Checking 
While sshing into a server, we need to provide the username and private_key. But when we ssh into a server for the first time, we get a prompt asking us to verify the authenticity of the host. This is called as host key checking.

Ansible provides us with a way to disable the host key checking. We can disable the host key checking by adding the following line in the `ansible.cfg` file.

```
[default]
host_key_checking = False
```

* `host_key_checking` is a variable that is used to disable the host key checking.

* Ansible will not ask us to verify the authenticity of the host when we run the playbook.

* Ansible config file is located at `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg` on Linux.

* We can also create config file on user desktop. To create config file on user desktop, we need to create a directory named `.ansible.config` in the home directory of the user.
