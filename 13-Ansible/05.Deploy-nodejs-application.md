# Solution

## Create a droplet on DigitalOcean

As We already learned about terraform, This is the time to use it. We will create a droplet using terraform.

### Create a terraform file
```yaml
terraform {
    required_providers {
        digitalocean = {
        source  = "digitalocean/digitalocean"
        version = "~> 2.0"
        }
    }
    }

    # Configure the DigitalOcean Provider
    provider "digitalocean" {
    token = var.do_token
    }

# Create first web server
    resource "digitalocean_droplet" "web1" {
    name     = "my-droplet-1"
    size     = "s-2vcpu-4gb"
    image    = "ubuntu-18-04-x64"
    region   = "BLR1"
    ssh_keys = [digitalocean_ssh_key.droplet-ssh-key.fingerprint]
    }

# Create second web server
    resource "digitalocean_droplet" "web2" {
    name     = "my-droplet-2"
    size     = "s-2vcpu-4gb"
    image    = "ubuntu-18-04-x64"
    region   = "BLR1"
    ssh_keys = [digitalocean_ssh_key.droplet-ssh-key.fingerprint]
    }



    # Create a new SSH key
    resource "digitalocean_ssh_key" "droplet-ssh-key" {
    name       = "Terraform Example"
    public_key = file("/home/ankit/.ssh/id_rsa.pub")
    }

    //this will give ipv4 address of our newly created droplet
    output "droplet_ip1" {
    value = digitalocean_droplet.web1.ipv4_address
    }
    //this will give ipv4 address of our newly created droplet
    output "droplet_ip2" {
    value = digitalocean_droplet.web2.ipv4_address
    }

    resource "digitalocean_firewall" "web" {
    name        = "only-22-80-firewall"
    droplet_ids = [digitalocean_droplet.web1.id, digitalocean_droplet.web2.id]

    inbound_rule {
        protocol         = "tcp"
        port_range       = "22"
        source_addresses = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    }

    inbound_rule {
        protocol         = "tcp"
        port_range       = "80"
        source_addresses = ["0.0.0.0/0", "::/0"]
    }


    outbound_rule {
        protocol              = "tcp"
        port_range            = "1-65535"
        destination_addresses = ["0.0.0.0/0", "::/0"]
    }

    outbound_rule {
        protocol              = "icmp"
        port_range            = "1-65535"
        destination_addresses = ["0.0.0.0/0", "::/0"]
    }

    outbound_rule {
        protocol              = "udp"
        port_range            = "1-65535"
        destination_addresses = ["0.0.0.0/0", "::/0"]
    }
    }
```

### Create a variable file
```yaml
variable "do_token" {}
```

NOTE: Create a file named `terraform.tfvars` and add your DigitalOcean token in it.

### Initialize  and apply terraform
```bash 
terraform init # this will install the digitalocean provider
terraform apply --auto-approve # this will create the droplet
```

## Write a playbook to deploy a nodejs application on the droplet

### Create a playbook
```yaml
---
- name: Install node and npm     # this is a playbook
  hosts: droplet
  tasks: # these are the tasks that will be executed on the droplet
    - name: update apt and cache # this is a task
      apt: update_cache=yes force_apt_get=yes cache_valid_time=3600
    - name: install nodejs and npm
      apt:
        pkg:
          - nodejs
          - npm

- name: Create user
  hosts: droplet
  tasks:
    - name: create linux user
      user:
        name: ankit
        state: present
        shell: /bin/bash
        groups: sudo
        append: yes
      register: user_creation_status
    - ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "{{user_creation_status}}"


- name: Deploy nodejs app
  become: yes
  become_user: ankit
  hosts: droplet
  tasks: 
    - name: copy app files
      copy:
        src: /home/ankit/my_workspace/Ansible/project-1/nodejs-app-1.0.0.tgz
        dest: /home/ankit/
    - name: extract app files
      unarchive:
        src: /home/ankit/nodejs-app-1.0.0.tgz
        dest: /home/ankit/
        remote_src: yes
    - name: install app dependencies
      npm:
        path: /home/ankit/package
    - name: start app
      command:
          chdir: /home/ankit/package/app
          cmd: node server
      async: 1000
      poll: 0
    - name: check app is running or not
      shell: ps aux | grep node  # the difference between shell and command is that shell actually executes the command in the shell. 
      #We can also use env variables and pipes in shell. however command is more secure.
      register: app_status # register is used to store the output of the command in a variable
    - debug: msg={{app_status.stdout_lines}} # debug is used to print the output of the command on the screen
    # debug is quite helpful in playbooks. It is useful for debugging variables or expressions.

# We can reference variables in yaml files using {{variable_name}}.
# We can also use the variable in the name of the task. For example, we can use {{app_name}} in the name of the task.
# stdout_lines is a list of lines in the output of the command. We can use stdout_lines[0] to get the first line of the output.
# we can also reference a variable throughout the playbook
```

### Create a hosts file
```
[droplet]
<droplet_ip1>
<droplet_ip2>

[droplet:vars]
ansible_user=root
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/ankit/.ssh/id_rsa
```


### Run the playbook
```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook.yml
```



## Some important points
1. We can use the `ansible_user` and `ansible_ssh_private_key_file` variables in the hosts file to specify the user and the private key file to be used to connect to the droplet.

2. In this play we have used the `become` and `become_user` keywords. The `become` keyword is used to run the tasks as a different user. The `become_user` keyword is used to specify the user to run the tasks as. In this case we are running the tasks as the `root` user.

3. We have also added the `async` and `poll` keywords to the task that starts the nodejs app. The `async` keyword is used to run the task asynchronously. The `poll` keyword is used to specify the interval in seconds to check if the task is completed or not. In this case we are checking if the task is completed every second.

4. We have used `register` to store the output of the command in a variable. We can then use the variable in the next task. We can also use the variable in the name of the task. For example, we can use `{{app_name}}` in the name of the task.

5. Debug is quite helpful in playbooks. It is useful for debugging variables or expressions. We can use `debug` to print the output of the command on the screen. We can also use `debug` to print the value of a variable. We can also use `debug` to print the value of an expression. For example, we can use `debug` to print the value of `{{app_name}}`.

5. Make sure that you have node artifact in the same directory as the playbook. You can create the node artifact using the following command:
```bash
tar -czvf nodejs-app-1.0.0.tgz nodejs-app
or 
npm pack
```
